 # Project Description
 For this project, I wanted to make an app that would help others in keeping their Neocaridina and Caridina shrimps.
 This is a Full Stack application that keeps track of your aquarium tanks, you can add specific shrimps to your aquairums.
 Upon signing up, the app will keep track of your profile which holds your aquariums and guide bookmarks.

 ### Future Plans
 - Adding breeding tree with images and guides.
 - Implement more functionality for the profile section.
 - Add water parameter tracking (Display in graphs too)
 - Upload to the android playstore.

 # Setup & Dependencies
 - I am using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) in conjunction with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) for the front end
 - For the backend I am planning to host it locally on my machine with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), perhaps I will use laravel apis with this as I am familiar with that setup.
 - I used [Native Wind](https://www.nativewind.dev/quick-starts/expo) for CSS
 - Other than that you can view my package.json file above to view all dependencies
